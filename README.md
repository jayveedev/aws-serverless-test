## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+ recommended)
- AWS IAM user with programmatic access (Access Key ID & Secret Access Key)
- Basic understanding of AWS Lambda and API Gateway

## üìñ Complete Setup Guide

For detailed step-by-step instructions on setting up AWS and Serverless Framework from scratch, see **[AWS_SERVERLESS_SETUP.md](./AWS_SERVERLESS_SETUP.md)**. 

This comprehensive guide covers:
- AWS account and IAM user setup
- Credentials configuration
- Project initialization from scratch
- All dependencies and configuration files
- Deployment procedures
- Development workflows

## Quick Setup

1. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure AWS credentials:**

   Set your AWS credentials as environment variables:

   ```bash
   export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key-id
   export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-access-key
   export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
   ```

   Replace `your-access-key-id` and `your-secret-access-key` with your actual AWS IAM credentials.

3. **Deploy to AWS:**

   ```bash
   # Deploy to dev stage
   npm run deploy:dev

   # Deploy to production
   npm run deploy:prod
   ```

## Available Scripts

- `npm run deploy:dev` - Deploy to user-specific development stage (uses your username)
- `npm run deploy:prod` - Deploy to production stage
- `npm run invoke:local` - Deploy function to production stage ‚ö†Ô∏è *(Note: Script may need adjustment)*
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run format` - Format code with Prettier
- `npm run dev` - Start development server with user-specific staging ‚úÖ **Working!**

**‚úÖ Core development scripts are functional!** The credentials are properly configured and the main development workflow is operational.

### Recent Improvements

- ‚úÖ **Added comprehensive setup documentation** - New `AWS_SERVERLESS_SETUP.md` with complete step-by-step guide
- ‚úÖ Updated `deploy:dev` script to use user-specific staging for better team collaboration
- ‚úÖ Added `"type": "module"` to eliminate ES module warnings
- ‚úÖ **Fixed `npm run dev` script** - Works with user-specific staging using `whoami`
- ‚úÖ Added `cross-env` dependency for cross-platform environment variable support
- ‚úÖ Implemented automatic username detection for personalized development stages

## Development Script Details

The `npm run dev` script uses advanced configuration for seamless development:

```bash
# The actual command executed:
cross-env USER=$(whoami) sls dev --stage $USER-dev
```

**How it works:**
1. `$(whoami)` executes the system command to get your current username
2. `cross-env USER=<username>` sets the USER environment variable cross-platform
3. `$USER-dev` creates a personalized stage name (e.g., `jayvee-dev`, `alice-dev`)
4. `sls dev` starts serverless development mode with live AWS event redirection

**Benefits:**
- **No conflicts:** Each developer gets their own AWS stage
- **Team-friendly:** Multiple developers can work simultaneously without interference  
- **Automatic:** No manual configuration needed - detects username automatically
- **Cross-platform:** Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux (including WSL)

## API Endpoints

Once deployed, you'll have access to:

- **GET**: `https://your-api-id.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/{stage}/test`

Where `{stage}` will be:
- `prod` for production deployments (`npm run deploy:prod`)
- `{username}-dev` for development deployments (`npm run deploy:dev`)

**‚úÖ Successfully Deployed!** The endpoints are live and working after deployment.

Example response:

```json
{
  "message": "Hello World from serverless starter template!",
  "timestamp": "2025-07-26T15:26:56.168Z",
  "stage": "dev"
}
```

## Local Development

1. **Development server (Recommended):**

   ```bash
   # Start serverless dev mode with automatic user-specific staging
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will:
   - Automatically detect your username using `whoami` command
   - Create a personalized stage (e.g., `jayvee-dev` for user "jayvee")
   - Start serverless dev mode with live AWS Lambda event redirection
   - Enable faster development without slow deployments

2. **Test locally:**

   ```bash
   # Test the function locally (without AWS)
   npm run invoke:local
   ```

3. **Deploy and test changes:**

   ```bash
   # Deploy to shared dev environment
   npm run deploy:dev
   
   # Deploy to production
   npm run deploy:prod
   ```

## Customization

### Adding New Functions

1. Create a new file in the `src/` directory
2. Add the function configuration to `serverless.yml` under the `functions` section
3. Deploy the changes

### Environment Variables

Add environment variables in the `serverless.yml` file under `provider.environment`.

## Deployment

The template supports multiple deployment stages:

- **Development:** `npm run deploy:dev`
- **Production:** `npm run deploy:prod`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **"AWS credentials missing or invalid" error:**
   - Make sure you've set the environment variables correctly:

   ```bash
   export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key-id
   export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-access-key
   export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
   ```

2. **"Serverless plugin 'serverless-dev' not found" error:**
   - This plugin has been commented out in `serverless.yml` as it's not essential for basic deployment.

3. **First deployment taking a long time:**
   - This is normal! AWS needs to create the CloudFormation stack, Lambda function, and API Gateway.
   - Subsequent deployments will be much faster.

4. **Cross-platform development:**
   - The project uses `cross-env` to ensure environment variables work across different operating systems
   - The dev script automatically detects your username using `whoami` for personalized staging
   - If you encounter permission issues with `cross-env`, run: `chmod +x node_modules/.bin/cross-env`

## Current Status

‚úÖ **Fully Functional Development Environment!**

- **üìñ Complete setup documentation available** in `AWS_SERVERLESS_SETUP.md`
- Function deployments working with user-specific staging
- API Gateway endpoints are live and responding  
- CORS is properly configured
- **Core development scripts functional**, including `npm run dev`
- ES module warnings eliminated
- Development server with user-specific staging working seamlessly
- Cross-platform compatibility ensured with `cross-env`
- Team-friendly development workflow with personalized stages
